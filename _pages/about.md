My name is Charley Yejia Zhang (ç« ä¸šä½³) and I am currently a **5th year Ph.D. student** at the University of Notre Dame in the Computer Science and Engineering department. 
My doctoral advisor is [Dr. Danny Z. Chen](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/danny-chen/).
Previously, I received a B.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). 
I have over **8 years of coding experience** from research, making tools for in-lab machine learning & biomedical imaging pipelines, extra-curricular projects, and industry internships where I led the development of internal production systems. 

My research focuses on developing new deep-learning-based **computer vision approaches to tackle limited annotations for biomedical imaging tasks** (e.g., 2D & 3D anatomical structure segmentation, insect tracking & social dynamics analysis, automated medical diagnostics) where we have extensively collaborated with 6 institutions across 3 countries.  



*Currently looking for 2024 summer internships and fall full-time* ðŸ˜Š
