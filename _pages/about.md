My name is Charley Yejia Zhang (ç« ä¸šä½³) and I am currently a **final year Ph.D. student** at the University of Notre Dame in the Computer Science and Engineering department. My research focuses on developing new deep-learning-based **computer vision approaches to tackle limited annotations** (e.g., 2D & 3D image segmentation, self-supervised learning, multi-object detection & tracking) where we have extensively collaborated with 6 institutions across 3 countries. My doctoral advisor is [Dr. Danny Z. Chen](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/danny-chen/).

Previously, I received a B.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), specializing in computer engineering and machine learning. 
I have over **8 years of coding experience** from research, creating in-house machine learning libraries, personal projects, and industry positions involving production-level systems.
